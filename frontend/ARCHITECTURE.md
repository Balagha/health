The code is mostly divided into 3 parts - 
- Visitor
- Dashboard
- Auth

## Visitor

All pages that can be viewed without logging into the system (except for the auth pages) are bundled under this folder.

## Dashboard

Any page that requires logging in should be inside this.

## Auth

Signup and Signin pages and their related code are saved here.
